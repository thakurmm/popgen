The output files are three files
    1. homologous VCF files recreated with the populations as 1st 10 columns admixed, next 300 columns pure
    2. allele files recreated with the populations as 1st 10 columns admixed, next 300 columns pure
    3. Ancestry proportions file, with 1st 10 entires for admixed proportions and next 300 entries as pure
    
10 and 300 are input arguments to the python script - and so are the two "pure populations"
python create_admixed_chromosomes.py --num_admixed_chromosomes 10 --num_anchor 300 --source_pops CEU YRI

admixtures gives a proportion a particular individual is for two ancestries.
it takes a vcf files (actually bed file)
and (if input k = 2), then assumes the individuals in the bed are admixed from 2 pure ancestries
and assigns each individual a proportion for each of the 2 ancestries in the .Q file such that they add to 1.0

In this case, if you pass a file with ONE pure ancestry individuals only, then admixture will create
a .Q file with most columns being (close to 1, close to 0), or in other words, irrespective of k ....
only one column will be close to (1) and all other columns will be close to (0)

If you pass (k = 3), then admixture will assume three pure ancestries, and assign the proportion for
each individual in the .Q file such that they add to 1.0
---------------

On the other hand, structure-painter does something similar, except it may be providing results by
a SNIP across all individuals. The current theory to be verified is that
StucturePainter looks at one SNIP (one row in the VCF file) across all the individuals, makes a
determination that the SNIP at THAT position should be a 0 or 1. And once it has made that determination,
it scans all the individuals for that SNIP that do match and assign them the color "red" and the others
the color "blue".

So, with that thought, if you pass a file with ALL pure individuals from ONE population to StructurePainter,
it would paint the result "all blue" or "all red".
