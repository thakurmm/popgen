1. We download the phased data for each chromosome for individuals from the 1000 genome project.
    We should have 22 VCF.gz files with this data
2. We extract the individuals for the populations of interest listed in the SampleIDS folder from these VCF files
    We get 22 recoded .VCF files at this time.
3. We split the individuals as _1 and _2, and we create the allele and homologous files for each recoded vcf file.
    we get 22 split homologous.vcf and allele_vcf.txt files.
4. We are creating a training set which contains admixed individuals created by randomly combining the pure chromosomes
    AND the pure individuals as a homologous and allele_vcf.txt files
    We should have 22 training set files.
5. We then create a test set which ONLY contains admixed individuals created by randomly combining the pure chromosomes.
    We should have 22 test sets of ALLELE_vcf.txt and true_populations.csv files.
6. At this point, we need to vcftools-merge the training set VCF files into one VCF file, which can be fed to admixture
    to create a single .Q file across all the 22 chromosomes for the individuals.
    We ALSO need to create a .Q file for each chromosome vcf file too.
    So we should have a total of 22+1 Q files (1 combined, and 22 individual chr ones)
7. The combined AND the individual chromosome .Q file is passed as the all_admix_filename and chrom_admix_filename to test_ancestry.sh


Ultimately, the expectation will be to run the 22 admixed VCF files for the individuals of interest through STRUCTUREpainter,
and compare the painting done by the program with the results that we "know" because we created the admixture ourselves.
STRUCTUREPainter does not expect the knowledge of the "pure ancestors".

The reason we are sticking with only two ancestors at a time and one "mixed" ancestor, is because STRUCTUREPainter can only
handle 2 painted colors at this time.
